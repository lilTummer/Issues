I have recieved this chain helmet and it was better than my other I had because it had better defense, and it was legendary.
But when I went to Identify it the npc said this isn't tagged as "unique, rare, Legendary, or special" and on the helmet it
said it was legendary. I had already sold my other good helm but now I have this glitched helm that can't be identified and 
I didn't know what to do! Also the name of the helm is "Pelier".
